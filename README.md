JBoss BRMS Rule Execution Server and Simple Servlet Example
===========================================================

0. copy .niogit from the support folder to EAP_HOME/bin

0. Leverage BRMS Rule Execution Server (Realtime Decision Server)
  * Build & Deploy rule project 
  * In your EAP configuration EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties
    * Your user must have the "kie-server" role
  * From Business Central
    * Deploy -> Rule Deployments -> Register
      * Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server
      * Name: Test Server Name
      * User/Password: account with kie-server role
    * Click the "+" to the right of your new "Test Server Name", this will create the container
      * Name: Test
      * Valid GAV (get this from the Project Editor of your project) / or use the search mechanism, search for: brmstest
        * Group Name: com.redhat.test
        * Artifact Id: brmstest
        * Version: 1.0.1 
      * Click the radio button of your new container and click Start on the right
      * If you click on the right arrow of "Test", you can see the endpoint:
        * http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/Test
  * Use the brms-rule-server/RuleExecutionXmlPayloadGen POJO to generate your payload
  * Using your favorite REST client, call out to the new container and see what response you get back

0. Alternate: Build the project as a war and add to the EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments folder
  * Build & Deploy rule project
  * brms-demo project -> mvn package 
  * copy the .war in the target folder (EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments)
  * http://localhost:8080/brms-demo/ListenServlet
    * Listen Servlet initializes test data
    * BRMSServiceImpl calls for a ksession, copies data from model to BRMS fact
    * Depends kmodule/jar being generated by JBoss BRMS for fact model
    * Once executed will run through rules written for the data


0. Refreshed for BRMS/BPM Suite 6.1

Don't expect anything in return, watch the EAP system out (server.log) for messages of rules being executed.
