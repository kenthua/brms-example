Simple Servlet Rule Execution
=============================

0. Build the project as a war and add to the EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments folder

  * mvn package
  * copy the .war in the target folder

0. copy .niogit from the support folder to EAP_HOME/bin

0. http://localhost:8080/brms-demo/ListenServlet

  * Listen Servlet initializes test data
  * BRMSServiceImpl calls for a ksession, copies data from model to BRMS fact
  * Depends kmodule/jar being generated by JBoss BRMS for fact model
  * Once executed will run through rules written for the data

0. Refreshed for BPM Suite 6.1

Don't expect anything in return, watch the EAP system out (server.log) for messages of rules being executed.
